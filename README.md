Geodude is a tiny command-line utility for geocoding addresses.

#### Features

* Geocodes and reverse geocodes addresses
* Minimalist interface
* Fast

#### Limitations

* Geodude depends on the wonderful
  [golang-geo](https://github.com/kellydunn/golang-geo) and is constrained by
  the rate limits of the APIs used by it.

### Installation

    $ go get github.com/zachlatta/geodude

### Usage

    $ geodude [OPTION] [address]

#### Examples

```
$ geodude 1600 amphitheatre parkway
37.422611       -122.0840577    1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA
```

Pretty printing:

```
$ geodude -p 1 infinite loop

Address: 1 Infinite Loop, Cupertino, CA 95014, USA
Coordinates: 37.331741, -122.0303329
```
